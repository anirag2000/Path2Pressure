Path2Pressure is an innovative Android app developed in Android Studio that leverages the smartphone's barometer to estimate the user's real-time location. This approach significantly reduces the reliance on GPS, offering a power-efficient alternative for location-based services. By utilizing atmospheric pressure data, BaroLocate provides a novel solution to achieve high location accuracy with substantially lower power consumption.
